# ajaxform

Allows you to submit your forms that were generated with the built-in form generator via Ajax.
After the installation you will have a new content element called "Form with Ajax" available.
Simply choose that and enjoy the magic.

It also works with redirects so you can use it in combination with e.g. ["mp_forms"](https://github.com/terminal42/contao-mp_forms).

This extension does not require jQuery or MooTools and thus only works in modern browsers.
